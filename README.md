# Calculus Computations & Proofs
This repository is a collection of computational calculus tools and documented mathematical proofs. It combines the numerical and symbolic power of GNU Octave and LaTeX expressions.

## 🛠 Prerequisites

To run the files in this repository, ensure you have the following installed:

### GNU Octave
* **Octave 6.0+**: [Download here](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/download).
* **Symbolic Package**: Required for analytical differentiation/integration.
    ```octave
    pkg install -forge symbolic
    pkg load symbolic
    ```

### LaTeX
* A distribution such as **TeX Live**, **MiKTeX**, or **MacTeX**.
* Alternatively, you can upload the `.tex` files to [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com).
